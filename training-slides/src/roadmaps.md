## Module: Applied Rust

### Day 1, Session 1:

* [Methods and Traits](./methods-traits.md)
* Exercise: Shapes, Part I - adding methods to structs

  * Writing methods inside an `impl` block
  * Talking about the difference between `&self`, `&mut self` and `self` (and when to use them)

### Day 1, Session 2:

* [Cargo Dependencies and Workspaces](./using-cargo.md)
* [Rust I/O Traits](./io.md)
* Exercise: Connected Mailbox

  * Writing an application that uses a dependency
  * Putting two crates in a workspace
  * Opening TCP sockets and processing string data

### Day 1, Session 3:

* [Generics](./generics.md)
* [Lifetimes](./lifetimes.md)
* Learning Goals:
  * Adding lifetime specifiers to fix the *needle in a haystack* function
  * Talking about the difference between a *Lifetime* and a *Lifetime Specifier*

### Day 2, Session 1:

* [Heap Allocation (Box and Rc)](./heap.md)
* [Shared Mutability (Cell, RefCell)](./shared-mutability.md)
* Learning Goals:
  * Describe the stack vs the heap
  * Use `Cell` to make a `Copy` type mutable though a shared reference
  * Use `RefCell` to make a non-`Copy` type mutable though a shared reference

### Day 2, Session 2:

* [Thread Safety (Send/Sync, Arc, Mutex)](./thread-safety.md)
* [Closures and the Fn/FnOnce/FnMut traits](./closures.md)

  * Write a closure which borrows from the environment

### Day 2, Session 3:

* [Spawning Threads and Scoped Threads](./spawning-threads.md)

* Learning Goal:
  * Able to write a program that spawns threads

### Day 3:

* No scheduled content - the trainer will pick topics with the team
