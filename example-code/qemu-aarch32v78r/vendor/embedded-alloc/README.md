# `embedded-alloc`

> A heap allocator for embedded systems.

Note that using this as your global allocator requires Rust 1.68 or later.
(With earlier versions, you need the unstable feature `#![feature(default_alloc_error_handler)]`)

This project is developed and maintained by the [libs team][team].

## Example

Starting with Rust 1.68, this crate can be used as a global allocator on stable Rust:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern crate alloc;

use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use embedded_alloc::Heap;

#[global_allocator]
static HEAP: Heap = Heap::empty();

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // Initialize the allocator BEFORE you use it
    {
        use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
        const HEAP_SIZE: usize = 1024;
        static mut HEAP_MEM: [MaybeUninit<u8>; HEAP_SIZE] = [MaybeUninit::uninit(); HEAP_SIZE];
        unsafe { HEAP.init(HEAP_MEM.as_ptr() as usize, HEAP_SIZE) }
    }

    // now the allocator is ready types like Box, Vec can be used.

    loop { /* .. */ }
}
```

For a full usage example, see [`examples/global_alloc.rs`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-alloc/blob/master/examples/global_alloc.rs).

For this to work, an implementation of [`critical-section`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/critical-section) must be provided.

For simple use cases you may enable the `critical-section-single-core` feature in the [cortex-m](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m) crate.
Please refer to the documentation of [`critical-section`](https://docs.rs/critical-section) for further guidance.
